# discord-py-llm-sender
an ooba booga (or any llm runner and hoster thing) for discord.py
# Requirements:
- A PC running https://github.com/oobabooga/ (anything simillar will work but you have to tinker with the get_assistant_response function)
- discord.py==1.7.2 (anything newer or older won't work)
- A LLM model (could be anything you want but I recommend Dolphin LLaMA3)
# Howtorun:
- Make sure you have ooba booga or anything simillar as described above, now run it 
- Go to your Web UI Panel, then session, in extensions click openai, press `Save UI defaults to settings.yaml` and press apply flags/extensions and restart
- Go to model, download a LLM Model (if you haven't already) and load it
- Run the .py, type the Discord Authentication Token and enjoy.
